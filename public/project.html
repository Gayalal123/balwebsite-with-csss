<p>Building a Resilient Future Economy: Fostering Innovation, Sustainability, and Future Economy emphasizes how important it is to set up an economic structure that can change with the times and prosper in a world that is constantly evolving. It entails encouraging innovation to spur economic expansion and technical breakthroughs while also placing a high priority on

With innovation and sustainability working together as key pillars for a robust and flourishing future economy, the goal is to foster a forward-thinking economy that can endure setbacks, embrace new trends, and bring forth lasting prosperity for future generations. 
Background.G- Festis a brainchild of a group of students, who had conceived it as an important student-initiative in 2016. However, they could realize their conception only in 2017. Hence, this initiative still creates platforms for students and nurtures their academic, intellectual and social 
talents through various competitive events. It also gives the organizing team and its volunteers opportunities to learn organizational skills. After the second and third editions of the festival, we 
could not organize it for two years owing to the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions. This year we 
revived it, the fourth edition, after the gap of three years.
